# Affects AI Research Dataset Toolkit (AARDT)
This is a utility library for working with AER Datasets available to the academic community for research in 
automated emotion recognition. While it may likely be applied to datasets in other research areas, the author(s)' 
are primarily focused on AER. 

We are happy to support you by accepting pull requests that make this library more broadly applicable, or by accepting
issues to do the same. If you have an AER dataset you would like us to integrate, please open an issue for that as well, 
but we will be unable to process issues requesting integration with non-AER datasets at this time.

If you would like to get involved by maintaining dataset integrations in other areas of research, please get in touch 
and we'd be happy to have the help!
